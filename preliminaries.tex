\chapter{Preliminaries}

In this section, we define polynomial-time reductions between total search problems
and the complexity class \CLS.
%
\begin{definition}
For total functions problems, a (polynomial-time) reduction from problem~$A$ to
problem $B$ is a pair of polynomial-time functions $(f,g)$, such that $f$ 
maps an instance $x$ of $A$ to an instance $f(x)$ of $B$, and $g$ maps
any solution $y$ of $f(x)$ to a solution $g(y)$ of $x$.
\end{definition}
%
Following~\cite{daskalakis2011continuous}, we define the complexity class $\CLS$
as the class of problems that are reducible to the following problem \CLO.

\begin{definition}[\CLO~\cite{daskalakis2011continuous}]
\label{def:CLO}
Given two arithmetic circuits computing functions $f : [0,1]^3\to [0,1]^3$ and $p :
[0,1]^3 \to [0,1]$ and parameters $\e, \lambda > 0$, find either:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,label=(C\arabic*)]
\item a point $x\in [0,1]^3$ such that $p(x) \leq p(f(x)) - \e$ or \label{c_fixpoint}
\item a pair of points $x,y\in [0,1]^3$ satisfying either \label{c_violation}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(C\arabic{enumi}\alph*)] 
  \item $\Norm{f(x) - f(y)} > \lambda \Norm{x-y}$ or \label{c_bad_f}
  \item $\Norm{p(x) - p(y)} > \lambda \Norm{x-y}$. \label{c_bad_p}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

In Definition~\ref{def:CLO}, $p$ should be thought of as a \emph{potential}
function, and $f$ as a \emph{neighbourhood} function that gives a candidate
solution with better potential if one exists. Both of these functions are 
purported to be Lipschitz continuous. A solution to the problem is either an approximate
potential minimizer or a witness for a violation of Lipschitz continuity.

\begin{definition}[\CM~\cite{daskalakis2011continuous}]
We are given as input an arithmetic circuit computing $f: [0,1]^3\to [0,1]^3$,
a choice of norm $\Norm{\cdot}$, constants \mbox{$\e,c \in (0,1)$},
and $\delta > 0$, and we are promised that $f$ is $c$-contracting w.r.t. $\Norm{\cdot}$.
The goal is to find
\begin{enumerate}[label=(CM\arabic*)]
\item a point $x\in [0,1]^3$ such that $d(f(x),x) \leq \delta$, 
\item or two points $x,y\in [0,1]^3$ such that $\Norm{f(x) - f(y)}/\Norm{x-y} > c$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

In other words, the problem asks either for an approximate fixed point of $f$ or
a violation of contraction. As shown in~\cite{daskalakis2011continuous}, \CM is
easily seen to be in \CLS by creating instances of \CLO with $p(x) =
\Norm{f(x)-x}$, $f$ remains as $f$, Lipschitz constant $\lambda = c+1$, and $\epsilon =
(1-c)\delta$.

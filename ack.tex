I'd like to thank Ruta Mehta for her wonderful guidance and support during this project and more generally. I've been tremendously fortunate to have her as an adviser and I attribute much of my growth as a researcher to trying to follow her example. This thesis would not be possible without her.

I'd also like to thank Mahesh Viswanathan for his thoughtful advice and fruitful collaboration.

I'd like to thank Rahul Savani and John Fearnley. They've been fantastic to work with and have made this project far more successful than it otherwise would have been.

Finally, I'd like to acknowledge all of my friends and professors at UIUC, who are jointly responsible for making these past two years so enjoyable and rewarding.
